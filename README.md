Custom React Cursors
Custom React Cursors is a library that allows you to create custom cursor effects in your React applications.

Installation
You can add Custom React Cursors to your project using npm or yarn.

bash
Kodu kopyala
npm install custom-react-cursors
or

bash
Kodu kopyala
yarn add custom-react-cursors
Usage
To use Custom React Cursors, import the CustomCursor component into your project and include it in your component tree.

jsx
Kodu kopyala
import React from 'react';
import CustomCursor from 'custom-react-cursors';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <CustomCursor ringColor={'hotpink'} ballColor={'hotpink'} />
      {/* Your other components */}
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
In the above example, the CustomCursor component is imported from the custom-react-cursors package and included in the App component. You can customize the appearance of the cursor by passing ringColor and ballColor props to the CustomCursor component.

Customization
The CustomCursor component supports the following props for customization:

ringColor: Specifies the color of the ring around the cursor.
ballColor: Specifies the color of the cursor ball.
For example, to customize the cursor with a hot pink ring and ball, you can use:

jsx
Kodu kopyala
<CustomCursor ringColor={'hotpink'} ballColor={'hotpink'} />
Feel free to experiment with different colors to achieve the desired cursor effect.
